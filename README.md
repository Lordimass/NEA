# An Investigation into the Use of Machine Learning in Scrabble
This project currently only seems to run on `repl.it`, I genuinely don't know why, neither do I have the time to find out why.
If you do want to run it, you can do so here: https://replit.com/@SamuelKnight3/Scrabble-NEA

Please keep in mind that this is a school project, it was completed over a period of 18 months as part of my A-Level Computer Science course. That means I won't be maintaining the code in any way, it is no longer my priority.
I intend to include the full documentation that was created for this project once it is complete, but that's a 200+ page document, so good luck :)

Feel free to use this for any purpose. If this helps for your own NEA, good luck :D
